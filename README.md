# Epic Asteroid Game (Project02-SpaceShooter)
9/27/25
Destroy enemies and asteroids for points, collect powerups, and don't touch bullets!
## Implementation
-Added 2 additional asset packs (3 if including background) +1  
-Added an enemy variant +1  
-Added a powerup that doubles your shooting, increases bullet speed, and increases bullet lifetime. Powerup has a 1/3 chance to spawn from big asteroids when destroyed +1  
-Added a background image +1  
-Smoothed out game experience (Enemies and small asteroids give score upon being destroyed, player has no collision for 2 seconds after respawning to prevent spawn-kills) (Not necessarily for points but might be worth one in case if the last implementation isn't)  
-Remade the game into an endless RNG arcade game. Enemies spawn in random positions on a timer, same for asteroids. Hopefully worth 1 point (I imagine just adding music would've been much easier). +1
